	\chapter{GENERAL INTRODUCTION}
	
	\section{Introduction}
	The \bt{\tp (TP)} is the overall term for a wide range of issues in which transportation is required. The following are the general parameters of Transportation Problem:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\Alph{enumi})}
		\item \bt{Resources:} These are the elements that can be moved from one location to another. Goods, machinery, tools, people, and cargo are examples of discrete resources; continuous resources include energy, liquids, and money..
		
		\item \bt{Locations:} Point of delivery, recollection depots, nodes, railway stations, bus terminals, loading ports, seaports, airports, refueling depots, and schools are all examples of locations.
		
		\item \bt{Transportation Modes:} Transportation modes are methods of delivering resources to certain areas. Water, space, air, road, train, and cable are used as forms of transportation. The infrastructure, capacity, schedules, activities, and rules varies depending on the mode of transportation. Ships, planes, trucks, trains, pipelines, motorcycles, and other forms of movement are examples.
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{Definition of Terms}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \bt{Destination:} It is the location to which shipments are transported.
		\item \bt{Unit Transportation Cost:} It is the cost of transporting one unit of the consignment from an origin to a destination.
		\item \bt{Feasible Solution:} A solution that satisfies the row and column sum restrictions and also the none-negatively restrictions is a feasible solution.
		\item\bt{Basic Feasible Solution:} A feasible solution of $(m\times n)$ transportation problem is said to be basic feasible solution when the total number of allocations is equal to $(m+n-1)$.
		\item\bt{Optimal Solution:} A feasible solution is said to be optimal solution when the total transportation cost will be the minimum cost.
		\item\bt{Degenerate \& Non-degenerate Basic Feasible Solution:} A Basic Feasible Solution to the $m\times n$ transportation problem that contains exactly $m+n-1$ allocation in independent position is called non-degenerate basic feasible solution.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\section{Types of Transportation Problem}
	There are basically two (2) types of transportation problem:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Balanced \tp\\[-1.1cm]
		\item Unbalanced \tp \\[-1.3cm]
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{figure}[!h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.51\linewidth]{tt4}
		\caption{Types of Transportation Problem}
		\label{fig:1_1}
	\end{figure}
	
		\section{Model of A \tp}
	The \stp model is defined by
	\begin{gather}
		\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i=1}^{m}X_{ij}C_{ij}\label{eq:3_1}\sps
		\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{ij} \leq a_i~~,~~ i=1,2,3,\ldots,m~~ (\text{Demand Constraint}\label{eq:3_2}\sps
		\sum_{i=1}^{m}X_{ij} \geq b_j~~,~~ j=1,2,3,\ldots,n~~ (\text{Supply constraint})\label{eq:3_3}\sps
		X_{ij} \geq 0,1,2,3,\ldots,n\label{eq:3_4}
	\end{gather}
	
	\NI This is a Linear Program with $m\cdot n$ decision variables, $m+n$ functional constants, and $m\cdot n$ non-negative constraints. Where\sps
	$n$ is the number of destination\\
	$m$ is the number of resources\\
	$a_i$ is the capacity of $i$ source\\
	$b_j$ is the demand of $j$th destination\\
	$C_{ij}$ is the unit transportation cost between $i$th source and $j$th destination (in naira or as a distance in Kilometers, miles, etc.). While $X_{ij}$ is the size of material transported between $i$th source and $j$th destination (in tons, pounds, liters etc.).\sps
	
	\NI A \stp is said to be unbalanced if and only if
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i \neq \sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j\label{eq:3_5}
	\end{eqnarray} 
	
	\NI There are two cases:\\
	Case (1)
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i \geq \sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j\label{eq:3_6}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Case (2)
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i \leq \sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j\label{eq:3_7}
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	\NI To balance the Transportation Problem, introduce a dummy origin or source in the transportation table with a zero cost. The availability at the origin is
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i - \sum_{j=1}^{n}b_j = 0 \label{eq:3_8}
	\end{eqnarray}

%	\section{Mathematical Model of \tp}
%	In a typical \tp, a homogeneous product is to be transported from each of $m$ sources to any of $n$ destinations and their capacities are $a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1, b_2,\ldots, b_n$ respectively. In addition there is a penalty $c_{ij}$ associated with transporting a unit of the product from source $i$ to destination $j$. The penalty could represent transportation cost, delivery time, quantity of good delivered, safety delivery and many others. A variable $X_{ij}$ represents the unknown quantity to be transported from source $i$ to destination $j$. In the real life, all transportation problems are not single objective. Thus in general, the objective will also be controversial. In this paper, those \stps are considered, which are described by multiple objective functions.\\
%	
%	\NI The mathematical model of the multi-objective \stp is written as follows
%	\begin{eqnarray}
%		s_1: \text{Minimize } Z_k(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}C_{ij}^k x_{ij}, \quad k=1,2,\ldots,k 
%	\end{eqnarray}
%	subject to
%	\begin{eqnarray*}
%		\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_{ij} &=& a_i \qquad\qquad i=1,2,\ldots,m\sps
%		\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ij} &=& b_j \qquad\qquad j=1,2,\ldots,n\\[-1.5cm]
%	\end{eqnarray*}
%	\begin{gather*}
%		x_{ij} \geq 0, \qquad \forall~~ i \text{ and } j
%	\end{gather*}
%	Where $\dsp Z_k(x) = \left\{Z_1(x), z_2(x),\ldots, Z_k(x)\right\}$ is a vector of $k$ objective functions, the subscripts on $Z_k(x)$ and superscript on $C^k_{ij}$ are used to identify the number of objective functions $(k=1,2,\ldots,k)$ without loss of generality it will be assumed in the whole paper that $\dsp a:>0~~\forall~~ i,~~b_j > 0~~\forall ~~j,~ C_{ij}^k \geq 0 ~~~ \forall~~ (i,j)$ and $\dsp \sum_i a_i = \sum_j b_j$


	\section{Tableau And Network Representation}
	The \stp is illustrated with the model of a linear program and it appears in a network and tableau form

	\section{Background of Study}
	\subsection{Company Profile}
	The Unilorin Water Enterprise began operations on September 23, 2013, with the promise of producing sparkling clean water for the use of members of the university community and beyond. The Unilorin Water Enterprise is open from Mondays through Saturdays.
	
	\subsection{Company Brand}
	On March 4, 2014, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) approved Unilorin Water Enterprise (UWE) by assigning product registration numbers to the two water brands. Unilorin table water 50cl and 75cl bottles with registration number (1-2090L) and Unilorin Pure water with registration number (1-2049L).
	
	\subsection{Process of Production}
	The factory manufactures and packages the product in a calm and sanitary atmosphere; the company has five sedimentation tanks connected to a particular borehole, huwa-san, sand filter, carbon filter, and four treated water tanks. The business has a micro filter reserve osmosis, treated water tank, ultra violet sterilizer, and washing, filling, and capping equipment for sachet water, and an automatic packaging machine for bottle water.
	
	\subsection{Storehouses}
	The warehouse in the senior staff quarters store house stores raw materials, semi-finished items, and completed goods. This final goods and services are provided on time and at a low cost. There are only three registered transporters in charge of loading, packing, unloading, and moving finished items from the manufacturing warehouse to the distributors.
	
	\subsection{Distributions}
	Finished goods are sold directly to registered distributors. The distributors are the primary agents who distribute to retailers; the university of Ilorin water company produces on a huge scale and has over 70 distributors on and off campus. The firm produces about 4000 bags of sachet water, 500 packs of 50cl Unilorin table water, and 1000 packs of 75cl table water.

	\section{Problem Statement}
	The project will attempt to resolve the challenge of determining the ideal transportation plan that will reduce the overall cost of transporting products from the major production locations to the many important distributors in Ilorin who are geographically dispersed.

	\section{Aim and Objectives}
	The Aim of the study is to develop a transportation model of \uwe. The objectives  were to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\roman{enumi})}
		\item develop a model of distribution of Unilorin Water Enterprise (UWE) products as a \stp.
		\item minimize the transportation cost.
		\item maximize the profit.
	\end{enumerate}

	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%CHAPTER TWO%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}
	The \stp (TP) is an important Linear Programming (LP) model that arises in several context and has deservingly received much attention in literature.\\
	
	\NI The \stp is probably the most important special linear \stp in terms of relative frequency with which it appears in the applications and also in the simplicity of the procedure developed for its solution. The following features of the transportation problem are considered to be most important.\\
	
	\NI The \stp were the earliest class of Linear Programs discovered to have totally unimodular matrices and integrand extreme points resulting in considerable simplification of the Simplex method.\\
	
	\NI The study of the \stps laid the foundation for further theoretical and algorithmic development of the minimal cost network flow problems.\\
	
	\NI The \stp was formalized by the French mathematician Monges (1781). Major advances were made in the field during World War II by the Soviet/Russian mathematician and Economist Leomd Kantorovich. Consequently, the problem as it is now stated is sometimes known as the Monge-Kantorovich \stp. Kantorovich(1942) published a paper on continuous version of the problem and later with Gavurian, and applied study of the capacitated transportation problem Kantorovich et al (1949).\\
	
	\NI Many scientific disciplines have contributed toward analysing problems associated with the transportation problem, including operation research, Economics, Engineering, Geographic Information Science and Geography. It is explored extensively in the Mathematical Programming and Engineering literatures. Sometimes referred to as the facility location and allocation problem, the transportation optimization problem can be modelled as a large-scale mixed integer linear programming problem.\\
	
	\NI The origin of transportation was first presented by Hitchcock, (1941) also presented a study entitled \textit{`The Distribution of a product from several sources to numerous locations'}, this presentation is considered to be transportation problems. Kropmans, (1947), presented an independent study, not related to Hitchcock's and called \textit{``Optimum utilization of the transportation system"}. These two contributions helped in the development of transportation methods which involve a number of shopping sources and a number of destination. The transportation problem, received this named because many of its applications involve determining how to optimally transport goods.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%CHAPTER THREE%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
	
	\section{Introduction}
	This chapter reviews the proposed solution methodology and approach for handling transportation problem in \uwe. The \stp seeks to minimize the total shipping cost of transporting goods from  $m$ origins (each with a supply $s_i$) to $n$ destinations (each with a demand $d_j$) when the unit shipping cost from an origin $i$, to a destination $j$, is $C_{ij}$.
	
	\section{Mathematical Formulation}
	Supposed a company has $m$ warehouses and $n$ retail outlets. A single product is to be shipped from the warehouse to the outlets. Each warehouse has a given level of supply, and each outlet has a given level of demand. We are also given the transportation cost between every pair of warehouse and outlet, and these cost are assumed to be linear. More explicitly, the assumptions are
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the total supply of products from warehouse $i=a$, where $i=1,2,3,\ldots, m$
		\item the total demand of the products at the outlet $j=b$, where $j=1,2,3,\ldots, n$
		\item the cost of sending one unit of the product from warehouse $i$ to outlet $j$ is equal to $C_{ij}$, where $i=1,2,3,\ldots,m$ and $j=1,2,3,\ldots,n$. The total cost of a shipment is linear in size of shipment.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Solution of A \tp}
	\NI \bt{Solving the Transportation Problem:-} There are three popular methods to finding an initial basic feasible solution and they include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
		\item Northwest Corner Rule
		\item Least Cost Method
		\item Vogel Approximation Method
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection{Northwest Corner Rule(NCR)} 
	In this method, allocation of quantities being transported from source to some destination must start from the upper most left hand cell that is the Northwest Corner of the table. The steps include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
		\item Make allocation in the northwest (upper left) corner of the transportation problem table. Compare the supply of plant 1 say $S_1$ with the demand at the warehouse or destination 1 say $d_1$. Then,
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{(\roman{enumii})}
			\item If $d_1 < S_1$ i.e If the amount required at $d_1$ is less than the number of units available at $S_1$, set $x_{11}$ equal to $d_{1}$, find the balance supply and demand and proceed horizontally.
			
			\item If $d_1 = S_1$, set $x_{11}$ equal to $d_1$, balance supply and demand and proceed diagonally. Remember to make a zero allocation to the least cost cell in $S_1/d_1$.
			
			\item If $d_1 > S_1$, set $x_{11}$ equal to $S_1$, balance demand and supply and proceed vertically.
		\end{enumerate}
	
		\item Continue with $i to iii$, step by step away from the upper left corner until you reach a value in the South-East corner.
		
		\item calculate the total transportation cost.
	\end{enumerate}
	This method does not take into account the transportation cost and hence may not yield a good initial basic feasible solution.
	
	\subsubsection{Least Cost Method (LCM)}
	The Least Cost Method is also called the Matrix Minimum Method, is a method of finding an initial basic feasible solution where allocation of resources begins from the least cost. The steps includes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Determine the cell having the least transportation cost ($C_{ij}$)
		
		\item Allocate as much as possible to this least cost
		
		\item If there's a tie in least cost, select the cell having the greatest least cost.
		
		\item Delete the row or column which has been exhausted
		
		\item Select the next least cost and allocate as much as possible
		
		\item Continue this manner till all row and column requirements are met.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection{The Vogel Approximation Method(VAM)}
	This procedure is an iterative method of finding an initial basic feasible solution. It is an improved version of the least cost method. The steps include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the difference between the least cost and next least cost of each row and column(This difference is the row or column penalty).
		
		\item Select the row or column with the biggest penalty
		
		\item In case of a tie in penalty, select the row or column with the greatest least cost
		
		\item Make allocation as much as possible to the cell in that row/column
		
		\item Delete the column or row that has been completely exhausted.
		
		\item Repeat steps 1 to 5 until all allocation are made
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Numerical Illustration}
	Consider A company which has 3 production facilities $S_1, S_2$ and $S_3$ with production capacity of $7,9$ and $18$ units(in 100's) per week of a product, respectively.

	\chapter{SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION}
	\section{SUMMARY}
	Transportation costs are a significant component of every company's overall cost structure. The company (Unilorin Water Enterprise) may quickly and efficiently organize its transportation by using this mathematical model (the Transportation Model). such that it not only saves money on transportation but also saves time by identifying products and services at the right place and correct time.
	
	\section{CONCLUSION}
	The Northwest Corner Cell Method, Least Cost Method, and Vogel's Approximation approaches are used to discover the initial basic workable solution to a transportation problem. Vogel's approximation approach is an upgrade on the Least Cost Cell method that yields a better result. The Northwest Corner Cell approach is the simplest but most inefficient since it does not account for the cost of transportation for all conceivable alternative routes. Because costs are included for allocation, the Least Cost method is preferable to the Northwest Corner Cell method.

	\section{RECOMMENDATION}
	Based on the study findings, I recommend that Unilorin Water Enterprise's management seek the incorporation of mathematical models or theories into their operations as a necessary tool for decision making, not only in the area of logistics (the transportation problem), but also in production and administration.\\
	
	\NI This study used mathematical techniques to solve management difficulties and make best decisions in a timely manner. If the University of Ilorin Water Enterprise used the suggested transportation model, it would help them plan out their transportation schedule more efficiently and at a lower cost. This strategy may be used to any transportation challenge
